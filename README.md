# üß™ Browser Forensics - Cryptominer Lab

This project showcases my forensic investigation of a suspected cryptomining operation hidden within browser activity. Conducted through a Blue Team Labs Online challenge, I used REMnux and a combination of open-source tools to analyze browser data, inspect JavaScript files, and identify malicious behavior tied to a Chrome extension.

## üîç Investigation Highlights

### üß≠ Browser Profiles Identified

- Located 2 Chrome user profiles inside the USB evidence:
  - `Default`

### üé® Theme Discovery

- Detected an installed Chrome theme through extension metadata. I was able to find this fairly quickly by looking at the times when "themes" were searched through Browser History View and compared them to the extenstions file times in FTK:
  - Extension ID: `egnfmleidkolminhjjkaomjefheafbbb`  
  - Extension Name: **"DFP CryptoCurrency Miner"**
  - Description text: "Allows staff members to mine cryptocurrency in the background of their web browser"
  - Correlated to theme: Earth in Space

### üìú Suspicious Extensions

- Identified a suspicious Chrome extension installed:
  - Extension ID matched known mining scripts
  - Name: `ScreenShader`
  - JavaScript file (`background.js`) contained obfuscated and encoded scripts

### üß¨ JavaScript File Analysis

- Located JavaScript files within:
  - `AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions`
- Scripts included:
  - Obfuscation layers
  - Web worker functions linked to CoinHive (deprecated crypto-mining service)

## üéØ Conclusion

This investigation highlights the importance of browser forensics in identifying malware hidden in user profiles and browser extensions. By analyzing profile data and decoding JavaScript, I uncovered a cryptominer that silently leveraged browser resources.
